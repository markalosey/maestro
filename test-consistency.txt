# AI Assistant Consistency Test

This file was created to test the AI assistant consistency implementation in the MAESTRO project.

## Test Results

✅ .cursorignore patterns working correctly
✅ .cursor directory structure created
✅ Core behaviors rule implemented
✅ Git workflow commands created
✅ Sequential thinking pattern tested

## Implementation Status

- Phase 1: Foundation ✅ Complete
- Phase 2: Enhanced Behavior ✅ Complete  
- Phase 3: Testing ✅ In Progress

The AI assistant should now follow consistent patterns for:
- Git workflow (pwd → git status → git add → git commit → git push)
- Sequential thinking for complex problems
- MAESTRO-specific development patterns
- Proper context management through .cursorignore
