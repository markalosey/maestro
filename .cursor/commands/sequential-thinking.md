# Sequential Thinking Command

## Usage

/sequential-thinking

## Purpose

Use structured thinking for complex problems in MAESTRO development

## When to Use

- Complex analysis requests
- Multi-step problem solving
- Planning and design tasks
- When user asks "how should I approach this?"
- MAESTRO architecture decisions
- AI agent coordination issues
- Database schema design
- API endpoint planning
- Frontend component architecture

## Behavior

1. Use `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool
2. Break down problem into clear steps
3. Revise thoughts as understanding deepens
4. Test hypotheses before concluding
5. Provide structured reasoning process

## MAESTRO-Specific Use Cases

### Backend Architecture
- Planning new API endpoints
- Designing database schemas
- Coordinating AI agent interactions
- Optimizing RAG pipeline performance

### Frontend Development
- Planning component architecture
- Designing user workflows
- Optimizing state management
- Planning responsive design

### System Integration
- Docker container orchestration
- Database migration planning
- AI model integration
- Performance optimization

### Problem Solving
- Debugging complex issues
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Scalability planning

## Example Scenarios

- "How should I implement real-time mission status updates?"
- "What's the best approach to optimize the RAG pipeline?"
- "How can I improve the agent coordination system?"
- "What's the most efficient way to handle large document processing?"
